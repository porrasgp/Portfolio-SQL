# Portfolio-SQL
A guide and summary to my projects and case studies for SQL.  Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). 


Hi there! 🙋🏻‍♀️

Welcome to my Portfolio Guide where I provide a walkthrough to all of my data analytics projects and courses.
